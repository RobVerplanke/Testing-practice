# Testing Practice

## Description

This project includes implementations of various functions and their associated tests as described in the testing chapter of "The Odin Project" course. Each of these functions is implemented using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) method, where tests are written first and then the corresponding function is implemented to satisfy those tests.

## Assignment

The assignment involves writing tests for different functions and then making those tests pass by implementing the corresponding functions. The functions to be implemented and tested are:

1. `capitalize`: A function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
2. `reverseString`: A function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. `calculator`: An object that contains functions for basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should accept two numbers and return the correct calculation.
4. `caesarCipher`: A function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character "shifted". It should handle wrapping from 'z' to 'a', keeping the same case, and dealing with punctuation.
5. `analyzeArray`: A function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
